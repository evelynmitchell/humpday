## Citing HumpDay

If you wish to cite HumpDay, thanks and maybe for now: 

     @electronic{cottonhumpday,
          title = {{HumpDay Optimization Package}},
          year = {2021},
          author = {Peter Cotton},
          url = {https://github.com/microprediction/humpday}
      }
      
 Although I have a book soonish: 
 
        @electronic{cottonbook,
          title = {{Microprediction: Building an Open AI Network}},
          year = {2022},
          author = {Peter Cotton},
          publisher = {MIT Press}
      }
      
which motivates HumpDay and other packages.
